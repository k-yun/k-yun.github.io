            <h2>First things first. Once you have a recipe, there are steps you will need to follow.</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a recipe.</li>
                    <p>There are so many to choose from. Don't get discouraged.</p>
                <li>Choose the right baking pan(s).</li>
                    <p>Round. Square. Rectangle. You can't go wrong.</p>
                <li>Allow the ingredients to come to room temperature.</li>
                    <p>An important step so all the ingredients mix well together.</p>
                <li>Prep the pan(s).</li>
                    <p>You don't want to serve the cake out of the pan, do you?</p>
                <li>Preheat the oven.</li>
                    <p>You want the oven waiting for you. You don't want to wait for the oven.</p>
                <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
                     <p>No clumps!</p>
                <li>Cream the butter and sugar together.</li>
                     <p>To make the cake light and fluffly</p>
                <li>Add the eggs...one at a time!!!</li>
                     <p>Each egg takes time to incorporate into the butter/sugar mixture. Give each egg their own time.</p>
                <li>Alternately add the dry and wet ingredients.</li>
                     <p>Dumping and stirring the batter will create a dense cake. If that's how you like it, knock yourself out. For a fluffier texture, add the dry ingredients slowly to prevent losing all that air incorporated from creaming the butter and sugar earlier.</p>
                <li>Pour batter into prepared pan(s).</li>
                     <p>What are you waiting for?</p>
                <li>Check cake for doneness.</li>
                     <p>There's a difference between a cake that's moist and a cake that's not done. Insert a skewer into the center of the cake and if it comes out clean, it's done.</p>
                <li>Cool the cake.</li>
                     <p>This helps the cake set and not crumble apart. This can take anywhere from 10 minutes upto an hour.</p>
                <li>Assemble the cake.</li>
                     <p>Stack the cake with a layer of frosting or jam (or both) in between.</p>
                <li>Frost!</li>
                     <p>Would you eat a cone without ice cream?</p>
