            <h2>Before we get started on this endeavor, let's gather what tools and equiment we'll need to get this cake started. Keep in mind you may or may not need everything listed below.
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Baking pans</li>
                    <div class="imagepans">
                        <img src="images/Baking-Pans.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>These come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and materials. Keep in mind that the darker colored pans tend to absorb more heat, therefore making the sides of the cake darker. It's important to use choose the correct pan that the recipe calls for or else you'll have to adjust the cooking times.</p>
                <li>Cooling rack</li>
                    <p>This allows air to circulate all around the finished product to cool evenly (and prevent sogginess).</p>
                <li>Food mixer</li>
                    <div class="imagemixer">
                        <img src="images/food mixer1.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Perhaps not the most important piece of equipment for a home baker, but it is most certainly a baker's best friend, especially if you are short on time</p>
                <li>Food processor</li>
                    <div class="imageprocessor">
                        <img src="images/food processor1.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Like the food mixer, this piece of equipment is so helpful and useful in so many ways. And the great thing about the food process is that it's not just for baking Slice, shred, mince, chop, and puree away!</p>
                <li>Liquid measuring cups</li>
                    <div class="imagemeasurecup">
                        <img src="images/measuringcup.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>Great for measuring liquids. Also helps pour batter that's more liquidy cleanly.</p>
                <li>Measuring spoons</li>
                    <div class="imagemspoons">
                        <img src="images/measuring-spoons1.jpg"></img>
                    </div>
                    <p>Tablespoon versus teaspoon? Yes, there is a difference!</p>
                <li>Mixing bowls</li>
                     <div class="imagebowls">
                        <img src="images/mixingbowls.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                     <p>Unfortunately, not all cakes are dump cakes where all the ingredients can be thrown into one bowl. Any material would be suitable (plastic, glass, metal), but you may want to invest into ones you can place in the microwave or over a pot of simmering water.</p>
                <li>Parchment paper</li>
                     <p>A must for cake or any other baked goods not sticking to the pan.</p>
                <li>Rolling pin</li>
                    <div class="imagerollpin">
                        <img src="images/rolling-pin.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                     <p>Used for rolling dough, icing, and crushing cookies or crackers. These come in a variety of sizes and materials, including wood, marble, and silicone.</p>
                <li>Scales</li>
                    <div class="imagescale">
                        <img src="images/foodscale.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                     <p>The key to accurate baking is having a good scale to weigh ingredients. Although if patience isn't your virtue, you can always measure out your ingredients.</p>
                <li>Sieve</li>
                    <div class="imagesieve">
                        <img src="images/white-flour.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                     <p>Usually made of metal or plastic, this is ideal for sifting large amounts of dry ingredients together to remove any lumps and incorporating ingredients together.</p>
                <li>Spatula/Spoons</li>
                     <p>These in invaluable tools. These instruments come in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials. Depending on the task at hand, these are used to mix, stir, transfer, scrape, and frost your products.</p>
                <li>Whisk</li>
                    <div class="imagewhisk">
                        <img src="images/whisk.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                     <p>This is designed to aerate and provide volume and therefore important to cake making. Handheld whisks are great for an upper body workout while handheld electric or a food mixer with a whisk attachment will make your job a lot easier and faster </p>
            </ul>
        </div>
