            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350&#176F (177&#176C) and lightly grease the bottom only of your choice of the following pan(s):
                    <ul>
                        <li>one 9" x 13" pan</li>
                        <li>two 9" round cake pans</li>
                        <li>three 8" round pans</li>
                        <li>wells of two muffin tins (24 muffin cups). You can also line the muffin tins with papers, and spray the insides of the papers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Sift or whisk together the sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the butter to the sifted dry ingredients and beat with an electric mixer at low speed (until the mixture resembles sand).</li>
                <li>Combine the milk and vanilla together and add all at once. Continue to mix at low speed for 30 seconds, then increase the speed to medium and beat for an additional 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Stop the mixer and scrape the bottom and sides of the mixing bowl to ensure all the ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
                <li>With the mixer running at low speed, add the first egg. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Repeat this procedure with the second egg. Continue adding the eggs, scraping after each addition, until all 4 are added.</li>
                <li>After the last egg is added, scrape the bowl once more, then beat at medium-high speed for 30 more seconds.</li>
                <li>Transfer the batter to the pans of your choice. For layers, divide the batter among the pans. Smooth out the tops with an offset spatula or the back of a tablespoon. For cupcakes, scoop by heaping 1/4-cupfuls into the prepared muffin tins.</li>
                <li>Bake for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>40 minutes for a 9" x 13" pan</li>
                        <li>27 minutes for 9" layers</li>
                        <li>24 minutes for 8" layers</li>
                        <li>23 to 25 minutes for cupcakes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Check for cake doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center and if it comes out clean, it's done!</li>
                <li>Allow the cake to cool for 5 minutes. After this time, remove it from the pan and allow it to continue to cool on a cooling rack.</li>
            </ol>
